    "This plot represents the total number of avoidable deaths due to heart disease and stroke per 100,000 people by county. An 'avoidable death' is one that occurs in an adult under the age of 75. Of the three variables of interest, the range for this indicator is the largest. Yet, there is a clear pattern of  estimates at the lower end of the range for a majority of the country. This likely indicates some skewness in the data, with a smaller number of extreme values at the upper end of the range (indicated by counties in red). Compared to other regions of the US, there is a pattern of a higher number of avoidable deaths in the southeastern counties. The highest concentration of a high number of avoidable deaths, based on visual examination, appears to be in Oklahoma.\n",

Some examples of physical activities include running, walking for exercise, golf or gardening. The range of prevalence estimates here are slightly larger than the range for the cholesterol variable above.  As with previous visualizations, there is a concentration of higher prevalance of no exercise in the southeast, particularly in Mississippi counties. Interestingly, there are several counties in South Dakota with high rates of non-exercise, but these same counties have relatively low rates of both adults with high cholesterol and avoidable deaths due to heart disease and stroke.\n",

    "The visualizations presented above provide a broadband overview of the health of American adults based on three indicators related to cardivascular health and physical exercise. While the data are presented in different scales, preliminary examinations of the graphs highlight geographic consistency for regions with poorer health outcomes; the southeastern US in particular. While these graphics do not directly imply a causal link between exercise and cardiovascular outcomes, physical excerise is a known modifiable risk factor for cardivascular health. It is important to note that these graphics provide a population-level overview of these indicators and do not capture factors that may explain regional differences.  "
